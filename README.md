# LDM
Language Detection Model

In this Language Detection Model (NLP Project), I have built this model for the detection of five languages namely English, German, French, Spanish
and Chinese Traditional etc.
This model involves the use case of Text classification in NLP to build up a classification model and uses logistic regression for the language detection.
The model involves the use of different libraries for implementation.
The Implementation of LDM involves various methods such as loading the corpus of each language, Data Pre-Processing of corpus of each language, Splitting Data into 
Train and Test sets, Vectorization (Tfidf) and Model-fitting then Model Prediction and Evaluation etc.
At last, I have also saved and load the model using the pickle library for the services configured with APIs.
Also, I have defined a method for the pupose of Language Detection for any random text.
